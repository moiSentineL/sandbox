# sandbox, lol 
As the name suggests, this repo contains a lot of stuff that don't have an innate meaning, but it serves a purpose: to evoke creation and metamorphosise into something bigger.

I make the stuff to:
- see what i've learned
- make sure my coding stuff is not so rusty
- do math stuff
- test things.
